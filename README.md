# jesses-crawl

Jesses's Girl got nothing on Jesse's Crawl(er)

The crawler is pretty simple. Clone the repo and run it. You'll need to have Python 3 and Selenium installed.
This version has the browser open for testing. We can use the phantomJS later on

For now, it only gets the first program, report and org only, there is no loop.

The only issue I am having at the moment is that when I click on the first checked item (seems 2017 is checked at the start) it does not uncheck, for some reason. Will look more careful into it later on
